        "Ans - The purpose of the call method in python is o make instances of a class callable meaning they can be used like functions , when you implement the call method can  be called using parentheses just like you would call a function\n",
        "\n",
        "* It allows objects to be invoked with the function call syntax instance()\n",
        "\n",
        "* The __cal__method can take any number of argumemts just like regular function\n",
        "\n",
        "* function factories or function like objects\n",
        "\n",
        "* Stateful functions that maintain data betwen calls\n",
        "\n",
        "* callbacks with configurable behaviour\n",
